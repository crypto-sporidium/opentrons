Hello fellow iGEM Opentrons Winners! 

Congratulations  on receiving your OT-2s! We (The UC Davis Team) are really excited to put our robot to use, and have been busy designing a protocol to use the OT-2 to automate the iGEM calibration and measurement protocols. 

Our goal for this Inter-Lab collaboration is to collect data and determine the accuracy of the OT-2 compared to humans. To do this, we ask that you follow our protocol and perform 3 sets of Serial Dilutions both by hand and with your OT-2. 

Attached is our automation script, protocols, and excel spreadsheets. After completing your data, send us the final spreadsheets, so we can analyze the accuracy of our OT-2s! If you have any questions concerning the protocol or using your OT-2, shoot us an email and we will answer them as best we can. 

A secondary goal for this collaboration is to facilitate communication between iGEM teams who have received the Opentrons OT-2. We are currently trouble shooting our OT-2 and developing protocols that will be beneficial in the iGEM context, if you have any insights into how to optimize iGEM automation, feel free to share in this email chain! Additionally If you are interested in joining our OT-2 Team Drive through Slack to share protocols, please let us know. 

Good luck, and thank you for participating!
