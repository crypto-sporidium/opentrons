Hello fellow iGEM Opentrons Winners! 

Congratulations  on receiving your OT-2s! We (The UC Davis Team) are really excited to put our robot to use, and have been busy designing a protocol to use the OT-2 to automate the iGEM calibration and measurement protocols. 

Our goal for this Inter-Lab collaboration is to collect data and determine the accuracy of the OT-2 compared to humans. To do this, we ask that you follow our protocol and perform 3 sets of Serial Dilutions both by hand and with your OT-2. 

Attached is our automation script, protocols, and excel spreadsheets. After completing your data, send us the final spreadsheets, so we can analyze the accuracy of our OT-2s! If you have any questions concerning the protocol or using your OT-2, shoot us an email and we will answer them as best we can. 

A secondary goal for this collaboration is to facilitate communication between iGEM teams who have received the Opentrons OT-2. We are currently trouble shooting our OT-2 and developing protocols that will be beneficial in the iGEM context, if you have any insights into how to optimize iGEM automation, feel free to share in this email chain! Additionally If you are interested in joining our OT-2 Team Drive through Slack to share protocols, please let us know. 

Good luck, and thank you for participating!

Automated Serial Dilution 
UC Davis iGEM 2019 

Repeat this Protocol Three Times with both your Opentrons OT-2 Robot and an iGEM Team Member

To best standardize this protocol, we have based it upon the 2019 iGEM Fluorescein and Abs600 Calibration Protocols. We invite you to perform serial dilutions using both your Opentrons OT-2 robot and a team member to determine the accuracy of the Opentrons OT-2.  


Tips: 
Be sure to set the robot to calibrate to the bottom of well A1 for each labware, by default the robot calibrates to the top. This setting can be found on the “Robot” page of the Opentrons application.
When calibrating the OT2 to the bottom of the instruments, make sure to go all the way to the bottom. If you cannot see the bottom of the 96 well plate, try marking a pipette tip with the appropriate height and lining it up with the OT2 while calibrating.** 
To avoid contaminating the pipette, do not fill 15mL tubes past 7mL**

Materials: 
iGEM Measurement kit 
Opentrons OT2 Robot
Opentons p300 pipette installed on the RIGHT
Opentrons p300 tips 
Opentrons 15mL tube rack (4 in 1 Rack)
Opentrons 96 well flat plate 
1XPBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)
Fluorescein kit tube
p300 Pipette 
15 mL conical tubes
ddH2O (double distilled water)

Protocol for Making 1X PBS
Dissolve the following in 800 mL DI water
8 g NaCl
 0.2 g KCl 
1.4 g Na2 HPO4 
0.24 g KH2 PO4 
Adjust the pH to 7.4 using HCl.
Fill to 1 L 
Filter (0.22 uM) Sterilize 

Fluorescein: 
Manual 
Spin down fluorescein kit tube to make sure reagent is at the bottom of tube
Prepare 10x fluorescein stock solution (100uM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1mL of 1X PBS
It is important that the fluorescein is properly dissolved. To check this, after the resuspension you should pipette up and down and examine the solution in the pipette tip – if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to mix the solution until they disappear.
Dilute the 10X fluorescein stock solution with 1X PBS to make a 1X fluorescein solution at 10 μM: 100 μL of 10X fluorescein stock into 900 μL 1X PBS into a 15mL tube.

Serial dilutions will be performed across columns 1-11. Column 12 must contain PBS buffer only. Initially you will setup the plate with the fluorescein stock in column 1 and an equal volume of 1X PBS in columns 2 to 12.
You will perform a serial dilution by consecutively transferring 100 μl from column to column with good mixing.
